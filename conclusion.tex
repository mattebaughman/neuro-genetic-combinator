\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The introduction of variation using fitness selection and crossover allows for quicker convergence and greater accuracy of certain neural networks. In our tests, we observed cases where little to no improvement was seen and we observed cases where error could be reduced  as much as 20\%. This seems to indicate dependence on initial condition and on specific network initializations and randomizations performed at the beginning of each workflow. In all, we have clearly presented a more efficient workflow for refining optimal parameterizations for neural networks compared to random retraining. Therefore, we have shown this methods viability to increase accuracy and reduce computation necessary for accurately training a RNN.
